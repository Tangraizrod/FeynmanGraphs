# FeynmanGraphs
This a repository for my research project in implementing graph kernel-based methods on Feynman diagrams. A new novel method to classify interactions.
functions.py are my helper functions and all comments have been added on how to use them. The dataset dictionary.json contains all the 66 Feynman Diagrams.

thank you for reading my dissertation
