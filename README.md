# FeynmanGraphs
This a repository for my research project in implementing graph kernel-based methods on Feynman diagrams. A new novel method to classify interactions.
functions.py are my helper functions and all comments have been added on how to use them. The dataset dictionary.json contains all 66 Feynman Diagrams. Note that some interactions have similar (or the same) drawn Feynman diagrams, but the directionality on the nodes changes, which makes it a different space-time interaction. Some interactions like some weak force ones look quite similar but note the change in labels or flavour, which actually makes them different interactions, as different interactions have smaller nuances.

Thank you for reading my dissertation
